Sanskrit, recognized as one of the most ancient languages known to mankind, holds a significant position in history due to its extensive influence on a wide range of Indo-European languages.

I found this topic interesting to approach because it has a highly systematic and regular grammar with precise rules for word formation, syntax, and phonetics, also because it holds a wide range of words and expressions, some of these represents specialized terms for various domains such as philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and literature.
